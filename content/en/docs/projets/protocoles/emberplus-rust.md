## Overview

A **Rust** implementation of the **Ember+** protocol, covering both the client (consumer) and server (provider) roles.

[Ember+](https://github.com/Lawo/ember-plus) is a control protocol used in the broadcast and audiovisual industry for communication between equipment (mixers, routers, monitoring systems...).

## Features

- Ember+ client (consumer) implementation
- Ember+ server (provider) implementation
- Written in Rust (performance, memory safety)

## Why Rust?

Rust provides excellent memory-safety guarantees and performance for a low-level protocol like Ember+, which requires reliable, low-latency communication.
